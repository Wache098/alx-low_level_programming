 makefiles
Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles. The tool determines which parts of the program need to be recompiled and issues the commands to compile them.

Makefiles are scripts used by the make utility to manage the build process of a project. They specify how to derive the target program from the source files, list dependencies, and contain rules on how to build the executable.
